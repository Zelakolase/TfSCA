## Class list (in src/)
- algorithms/
  - **Clustering** : TrSC clustering algorithm (inc. ranking eq.)
  - **Stats** : Calculation of Graph Completeness Ratio, Ratio of Connectivity, Mean, Standard Deviation
  - **GPI** : Calculation of General Performance Indicator
- lib/
  - **GORead** : Reads STRING-DB short TSV file to Graph object
  - **Graph** : Weighted undirected graph object (data structure + CRUD functions)
  - **IO** : Disk IO r/w
  - **SparkDB** : Check NaDeSys/SparkDB repository
- **App** : Make a ranked table comparing the mean GCR, mean-stdev GCR, mean RC, mean-stdev RC, num. clusters, GPI, and mean cluster size for MCL, Louvain, CliXO, infomap, and TrSC for all of the available dataset.
- **SingleGO** : Makes a report on TrSC clustering for a specified GO term in dataset.

## Indicators
- Graph Completeness Ratio (GCR): SumWeights divided by SumMaxWeights.
- Ratio of Connectivity (RC) : Num.Edges divided by Max.Num.Edges.
- General Performance Indicator (GPI) : Merges GCR and RC values to a single scalar.

## Build and Run
The current runnable classes are **App** and **SingleGO**
